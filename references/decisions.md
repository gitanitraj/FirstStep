# Decision 003

Housing Help returns many resource subtypes.

Observed during prototype testing.

Examples:
- Emergency shelter
- Transitional housing
- Rental assistance
- Domestic violence shelter

Conclusion:
A filter stage is necessary before showing results.

# Decision 004

Two filesystem reads used relative paths hardcoded to the repo root:
- ResourceService loaded `app/data/resources.json`
- ResourceController listed `backend/src/main/resources/static/images/seasonal`

This tied the app to being launched from the repo root and blocked deployment
from any other working directory (e.g. a container).

Conclusion:
Made both paths configurable via `@Value` properties, keeping the original
relative paths as defaults so existing behavior is unchanged:
- `app.data.dir` (default `app/data`)
- `app.seasonal.images.dir` (default `backend/src/main/resources/static/images/seasonal`)

A different working directory now overrides these via env/properties without
code changes. Chose `@Value` over `@ConfigurationProperties` to match the
existing style (OllamaService already injects `ollama.api.url` via `@Value`).
